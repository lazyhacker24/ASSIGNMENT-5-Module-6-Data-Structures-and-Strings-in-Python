# Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

# Step 1: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10
numbers = list(range(1, 11))
print("Original list:", numbers)

# Step 2: Extract the first five elements
first_five = numbers[:5]
print("Extracted first five elements:", first_five)

# Step 3: Reverse the extracted elements
reversed_first_five = first_five[::-1]
print("Reversed extracted elements:", reversed_first_five)
